"""Receiver-side audience-risk governance agent.

Exports:

  * ``root_agent`` — pure-LLM ``Agent`` (no tools); the prompt
    constrains output shape so the SDK extractor finds three
    candidate options per invocation.
  * ``build_receiver_plugin`` — factory that constructs a
    ``BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin`` writing to
    ``<RECEIVER_DATASET_ID>.<RECEIVER_TABLE_ID>``. The receiver
    server (``run_receiver_server.py``) attaches the returned plugin
    to a custom ``Runner``, since ``to_a2a()``'s default runner
    builder does not accept ``plugins=`` and would otherwise drop
    receiver telemetry on the floor.
  * ``APP_NAME`` — ADK app name for the receiver runner.
