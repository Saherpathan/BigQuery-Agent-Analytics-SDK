# One-command runner for the A2A Joint Lineage demo.
#
# Prerequisite:
#   ./setup.sh
#
# This script starts the receiver A2A server in the background, runs the
# receiver smoke gate, runs the caller campaigns, builds both per-org SDK
# context graphs, builds the auditor joint graph, runs the analyst agent
# against that graph (closing the loop), then stops the receiver.
