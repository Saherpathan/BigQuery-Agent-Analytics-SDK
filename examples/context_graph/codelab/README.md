# Codelab artifacts: periodic materialization

These are the artifacts the *Trace AI Agent Decisions with BigQuery Property Graphs* codelab uses. The codelab references them in place; you do not need to author any of them yourself.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `property_graph.sql` | Property-graph DDL. Stitches the node and edge tables into a queryable BigQuery property graph. **You apply this to BigQuery once; the deployed graph is then the single source of truth `bqaa context-graph --graph` derives the materialization spec from** (read back via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROPERTY_GRAPHS`). |
| `table_ddl.sql` | Node and edge table DDL. The materializer writes into these tables every run. |
| `seed_events.py` | Thin compatibility shim over the maintained `bqaa seed-events` command (SDK module `bigquery_agent_analytics.seed_events`). Writes a small corpus of completed decision sessions so the materializer has something to process. |

## How the codelab uses these

1. The codelab sets two shell variables: `PROJECT_ID` and `DATASET` (a single dataset that holds both raw `agent_events` and the materialized graph tables).
2. `envsubst < table_ddl.sql | bq query --use_legacy_sql=false` creates the node and edge tables.
3. `envsubst < property_graph.sql | bq query --use_legacy_sql=false` creates the property graph.
4. `bqaa seed-events --project-id "$PROJECT_ID" --dataset-id "$DATASET" --sessions 5` populates `agent_events` (the bundled `seed_events.py` remains as a compatibility shim if you are running from the downloaded kit).
5. `bqaa context-graph --project-id "$PROJECT_ID" --dataset-id "$DATASET" --graph agent_decisions_graph --lookback-hours 24` materializes the graph. It reads the deployed graph's definition back from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROPERTY_GRAPHS` and derives the entities, relationships, and column types from it plus the table schemas — no SQL file passed to the materializer, no ontology or binding file required.

### Advanced: explicit ontology + binding

When you outgrow derived mode — when you need human-readable descriptions to steer the AI extraction prompt, entity inheritance, derived (computed) properties, or column renames — author an explicit `ontology.yaml` + `binding.yaml` and pass `--ontology`/`--binding` in place of `--graph`. The [`examples/context_graph/`](../) example ships a complete checked-in pair (and the generator pipeline that produced them) as a reference.

## Domain model

The codelab models a generic agent decision flow with three node types and two heterogeneous edges:

```
DecisionRequest --[evaluatesOption]--> DecisionOption
              \--[resultedIn]--------> DecisionOutcome
```

`DecisionRequest` is the question the agent received. `DecisionOption` is one alternative the agent considered (a request typically has several). `DecisionOutcome` records the committed choice and the rationale.

## Adapting these for your domain

For a production deployment you author your own versions of just **two** files describing your decision domain, apply them to BigQuery, and `bqaa context-graph --graph` derives the rest from the deployed graph:

* `property_graph.sql` — `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH ... NODE TABLES (...) EDGE TABLES (... SOURCE KEY (...) REFERENCES ... LABEL ...)`.
* `table_ddl.sql` — `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for each node and edge table, with the SDK metadata columns `session_id` and `extracted_at` included on every bound table.

If you later need the explicit-override path, the files have this shape (see [`examples/context_graph/`](../) for a complete checked-in pair):

* `ontology.yaml` — entity definitions with primary-key declarations, plus relationship definitions naming their endpoint entities.
* `binding.yaml` — per-entity mapping from ontology property names to physical column names, plus per-relationship source-and-target column declarations.
