## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-18

### Release highlights

Focused follow-up to 0.3.0 that publishes the periodic-materialization
production path. The `bqaa-materialize-window` CLI merged after the
0.3.0 cut, so customers `pip install`-ing the SDK couldn't run the
cron path the migration v5 playbook documents. 0.3.1 closes that gap
and ships the surrounding deployment artifacts and a behavior fix:

- **`bqaa-materialize-window` CLI on PyPI** ([#162](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/162))
  — cron-friendly scheduled-graph-refresh command, available as a
  standalone console script and as a `bq-agent-sdk materialize-window`
  subcommand.
- **Empty-extraction silent-failure mode closed** ([#167](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/167))
  — `ok=true` is now an honest signal; per-session extraction
  failures classify as `empty_extraction` vs `materialization_failed`
  and flip `ok=false`. **Operator-visible behavior change** (see
  Fixed).
- **Cloud Run Job + Cloud Scheduler example** ([#165](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/165),
  [#166](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/166))
  — packaged deployment template under
  `examples/migration_v5/periodic_materialization/` with
  one-command deploy + `--smoke` end-to-end verification.
- **Customer playbook** ([#168](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/168))
  — the production cron path documented end-to-end: required
  APIs/IAM, recommended schedules, JSON log shape, Cloud Monitoring
  alerts, state-table inspection, teardown, troubleshooting.

### Added

- **`bqaa-materialize-window` console script** (PR
  [#162](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/162)).
  New cron-friendly entry point for keeping the materialized graph
  fresh on a schedule. Shipped as a standalone console script
  (`bqaa-materialize-window`) and as a `bq-agent-sdk
  materialize-window` subcommand; both call paths share
  `src/bigquery_agent_analytics/materialize_window.py`. Terminal-
  event-driven discovery (`event_type = @completion_event_type`,
  partition-pruned), pinned `run_started_at` snapshot, append-only
  state table keyed on a content-derived `state_key` (project +
  dataset + graph + events_table + ontology fingerprint + binding
  fingerprint + discovery mode), overlap-windowed re-scan for
  late-arriving events, per-session loop with idempotent retries
  and checkpoint advance only on success, worst-status-wins
  per-table aggregation, structured JSON report with C2 compiled-
  extractor outcome counters (`compiled_unchanged` /
  `compiled_filtered` / `fallback_for_event`), binding-validate
  pre-flight, checkpoint that never regresses across overlap
  re-scans, numeric/identifier guardrails at the boundary. Exit
  codes: `0` clean, `1` expected failure (session error or
  binding drift), `2` unexpected internal error.

- **Migration v5 Cloud Run Job + Cloud Scheduler example** in
  [`examples/migration_v5/periodic_materialization/`](examples/migration_v5/periodic_materialization/)
  (PRs
  [#165](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/165),
  [#166](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/166)).
  Packaged Cloud Run Job + Cloud Scheduler deployment that wraps
  `bqaa-materialize-window` for the migration v5 binding. One-
  command `deploy_cloud_run_job.sh` creates a runtime service
  account with narrow IAM (`dataViewer` on the events dataset,
  `dataEditor` on the graph dataset, `bigquery.jobUser` +
  `aiplatform.user` at the project, `run.invoker` on the job for
  the scheduler SA), deploys the job, wires the Cloud Scheduler
  trigger, and optionally runs `--smoke` to verify end-to-end in
  one shot. IAM matrix, dataset-role contract (events read-only,
  graph read/write), and live-deploy evidence captured against the
  canonical test project.

- **Migration v5 periodic materialization playbook** in
  [`examples/migration_v5/periodic_materialization/README.md`](examples/migration_v5/periodic_materialization/README.md)
  (PR [#168](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/168)).
  Documents the customer path for keeping the MAKO graph fresh on
  a schedule: local dry-run via `run_job.py`, Cloud Run Job +
  Cloud Scheduler deployment with `--smoke`, required APIs and
  IAM, recommended schedules, Cloud Logging JSON report shape,
  Cloud Monitoring alerts, state-table inspection, teardown, and
  troubleshooting. Complements the migration v5 four-guarantee
  notebook by covering the production cron path.

### Fixed

- **`materialize-window` no longer reports `ok=true` on silent
  extraction failures** (PR
  [#167](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/167)).
  Previously, when per-event extraction returned an empty graph
  (e.g., runtime SA missing `roles/aiplatform.user` so every
  `AI.GENERATE` call failed and was swallowed), the orchestrator
  reported `sessions_materialized == sessions_discovered`,
  `ok=true`, and an empty `rows_materialized` dict. Operators
  alerting on `jsonPayload.ok` saw "all good" while the entity
  tables stayed empty. Now, after `materialize_with_status`
  succeeds, the orchestrator inspects the materialized rows and
  per-table statuses; sessions producing zero materialized rows
  break the loop and classify the failure as
  `empty_extraction` (extraction returned empty — check AI/IAM)
  or `materialization_failed` (extraction produced rows but every
  insert failed — check write perms / schema). `ok=false` is the
  unmistakable red signal, and `failures[].error_code`
  distinguishes the failure mode without log digging. Per-table
  statuses now also surface in `result.table_statuses` for
  failed sessions (previously only `ok` sessions contributed).
  **Operator-visible behavior change**: alerts on
  `jsonPayload.ok=false` are sufficient; no second-line
  `rows_materialized == {}` check needed. The empty-window
  heartbeat path (`sessions_discovered == 0`) is unchanged — an
  idle cron firing still reports `ok=true`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-15

### Release highlights

Substantial feature release covering three major workstreams that landed
between 0.2.3 and 0.3.0:

- **Compiled structured extractors — full Phase C pipeline**
  ([#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75))
  — deterministic source generation, JSON-to-plan parsing, LLM-driven plan
  resolution, retry-on-gate-failure orchestration, runtime fallback wiring,
  runtime extractor-registry adapter, orchestrator call-site swap,
  compile-and-measure utility, revalidation harness, BigQuery-table bundle
  mirror, ``bqaa-revalidate-extractors`` CLI with ``--events-bq-query-file``,
  and an operational rollout guide. Replaces per-event LLM extraction with
  deterministic code on the hot path while preserving the LLM fallback for
  unrecognized event shapes.
- **Ontology runtime reader**
  ([#58](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/58)
  reader follow-on to PR #92's concept-index emission) —
  ``OntologyRuntime`` façade, ``EntityResolver`` Protocol with two reference
  implementations (``ExactEntityResolver``, ``LabelSynonymResolver``), and
  ``ConceptIndexLookup`` with fingerprint-strict verification across three
  trust points (eager ``verify()`` at construction, explicit re-checks,
  per-query ``WHERE compile_fingerprint`` defense in depth). Stable failure
  codes (``FingerprintMismatchError``, ``MetaTableMissingError``,
  ``MetaTableEmptyError``, ``MetaTableMultipleRowsError``).
- **Binding + extraction validation toolkit**
  ([#76](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/76),
  [#105](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/105))
  — ``validate_extracted_graph(...)``,
  ``validate_extracted_graph_from_ontology(...)``,
  ``validate_binding_against_bigquery(...)`` Python APIs;
  ``bq-agent-sdk binding-validate`` CLI for pre-flight validation;
  ``ontology-build --validate-binding`` and ``--location`` flags.

Examples shipped alongside the SDK release: the MAKO four-guarantee notebook
demonstrating the compiled-extractor pipeline end-to-end
([#107](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/107)),
and the A2A joint-lineage demo with auditor projections, the receiver
``A2A_INTERACTION`` typed view, and an audit-analyst agent that closes the
BQAA loop
([#129](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/129)).

### Added

- **``A2A_INTERACTION`` typed view (``adk_a2a_interactions``)** in
  ``src/bigquery_agent_analytics/views.py`` (PR
  [#136](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/136)).
  Surfaces the BQ AA Plugin's caller-side A2A delegation rows
  with JSON-extracted lineage columns —
  ``a2a_task_id``, ``a2a_context_id``, ``a2a_request``,
  ``a2a_response``, plus a ``receiver_session_id_from_response``
  COALESCE — so downstream consumers can join caller and receiver
  traces without writing the JSON-extraction SQL by hand. Used by
  the A2A joint-lineage demo's auditor projection.
- **``CodeEvaluator.context_cache_hit_rate(...)`` + CLI support**
  (PR [#114](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/114)).
  New pre-built evaluator in
  ``src/bigquery_agent_analytics/evaluators.py`` that measures
  Gemini context-cache prefix-hit rate
  (``cached_tokens / input_tokens``) per session, with
  cold-start / warm rate thresholds and an explicit
  ``fail_on_missing_telemetry`` switch. Wired through the
  ``bqaa evaluate --evaluator context_cache_hit_rate`` CLI path
  (``src/bigquery_agent_analytics/cli.py``).
- **``gm compile --emit-concept-index`` / ``--concept-index-table``**
  CLI flags in ``src/bigquery_ontology/cli.py`` (PR
  [#92](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/92),
  issue
  [#58](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/58)
  Phase 1). Emits a fingerprint-stamped concept-index table
  (``label`` / ``synonym`` / ``notation`` rows + ``__meta``)
  that the ontology runtime reader (above) verifies against.
  ``--concept-index-table`` is required when ``--emit-concept-index``
  is set — no silent global default.
- **``ontology-build --skip-property-graph``** flag in
  ``src/bigquery_agent_analytics/cli.py`` (PR
  [#108](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/108),
  issue
  [#104](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/104)).
  Materializes node and edge tables without issuing the
  ``CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH`` statement, letting users
  own their property-graph DDL while still letting the SDK
  populate the backing tables.
- **Ontology runtime reader** in
  ``bigquery_agent_analytics.ontology_runtime`` and
  [`docs/ontology_runtime_reader.md`](docs/ontology_runtime_reader.md).
  Issue [#58](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/58)
  reader follow-on to PR #92's concept-index emission.
  Public surface:
  * ``OntologyRuntime`` — façade that loads
    ``Ontology + Binding`` (from YAML files or in-memory
    models) plus an optional :class:`ConceptIndexLookup`
    wired to the emitted BigQuery table. Read-only
    accessors over entities / relationships / synonyms /
    annotations / SKOS schemes / notations / labels;
    provenance properties (``compile_fingerprint`` /
    ``compile_id``) computed locally.
  * ``EntityResolver`` Protocol + two reference
    implementations: ``ExactEntityResolver`` (in-memory
    match on ``entity_name``, no BQ roundtrip) and
    ``LabelSynonymResolver`` (BQ-backed match against the
    concept-index ``label`` / ``synonym`` / ``notation``
    rows, re-ranked by label-kind priority
    ``name > pref > alt > hidden > synonym > notation``).
    **No embedding / LLM / fuzzy in this slice** — explicit
    non-goals; future PRs can implement the Protocol
    without touching the runtime surface.
  * ``ConceptIndexLookup`` — BigQuery-backed accessor that
    is **fingerprint-strict**. Three trust points: eager
    ``verify()`` at construction (compares the table's
    ``__meta`` row against the locally-computed
    ``compile_fingerprint(ontology_fp, binding_fp,
    compiler_version)``); explicit ``verify()`` method for
    re-checks before long batches; per-query
    ``WHERE compile_fingerprint = @expected_fp`` as defense
    in depth so stale rows can't surface even mid-flight.
    Three lookup methods: ``lookup_by_label`` (with
    label-kind / language / case-insensitive filters),
    ``lookup_by_entity_name``, ``lookup_by_notation``.
    Stable failure codes: ``FingerprintMismatchError``,
    ``MetaTableMissingError``, ``MetaTableEmptyError``,
    ``MetaTableMultipleRowsError`` — all subclass
    ``ConceptIndexError``.
  CI suite (55 cases) uses in-memory fake BQ clients;
  live test (gated behind ``BQAA_RUN_LIVE_ONTOLOGY_RUNTIME_TESTS=1``)
  emits a real concept-index via PR #92's path, attaches
  the runtime, runs resolver queries against the live
  table, asserts provenance, drops the tables on the way
  out. Closes the last feature dependency for #107's
  four-guarantee notebook (the resolve beat).
- **Compiled-extractor rollout guide** at
  [`docs/extractor_compilation_rollout_guide.md`](docs/extractor_compilation_rollout_guide.md).
  Operational playbook for the Phase C pipeline (issue
  [#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75))
  stitching the five stages — Compile, Publish, Sync, Wire,
  Revalidate — into one flow. Treats Publish/Sync as the
  remote-runtime path; local / co-located deployments can
  shortcut to Compile → Wire → Revalidate. Worked BKA
  example uses Python snippets for the non-CLI stages
  (``measure_compile``, ``publish_bundles_to_bq``,
  ``sync_bundles_from_bq``,
  ``OntologyGraphManager.from_bundles_root``) and the real
  ``bqaa-revalidate-extractors`` shell invocation only
  where a CLI actually exists. Documents the **four trust
  gates** across the pipeline — the compile-time smoke gate
  inside ``compile_extractor`` (``load_callable_from_source``
  + ``run_smoke_test``, not ``load_bundle`` itself: there's
  no manifest at compile time) plus three real
  ``load_bundle`` runs at pre-publish, post-sync, and
  runtime-startup discovery — so the trust model is one
  mental model across the pipeline.
  Includes a failure-recovery playbook keyed on the stable
  failure codes each stage emits.
- **``--events-bq-query-file`` for ``bqaa-revalidate-extractors``**
  (issue [#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75)
  CLI follow-up). The CLI now accepts a BigQuery event
  source in addition to ``--events-jsonl``; the two are
  mutually exclusive and exactly one must be supplied.
  Contract: the SQL must produce exactly one column named
  ``event_json`` (STRING) per row, containing a JSON-encoded
  event dict — same shape ``--events-jsonl`` consumes
  line-by-line. The CLI does NOT auto-shape
  ``bigquery.Row`` objects; the query writer controls
  projection via ``TO_JSON_STRING(STRUCT(...))``. Row-level
  errors (missing column, non-string value, malformed JSON,
  non-dict decode) surface as exit 2 with the 0-based row
  index named so an operator can find the offender with
  ``LIMIT N OFFSET row_index``. BigQuery-side exceptions
  (auth, syntax, table-not-found, permission) are caught and
  surfaced with type + message — no traceback escapes.
  ``--bq-project`` is optional: the BigQuery client falls
  back to Application Default Credentials / environment for
  project inference; if both are absent the CLI exits 2 with
  ``Set --bq-project explicitly`` rather than confusing the
  operator with a downstream API error. ``--bq-location``
  defaults to ``US``. Client construction is centralized
  behind ``_make_bq_client(project, location)`` so unit
  tests inject in-memory fakes via ``monkeypatch.setattr``
  rather than wiring through every call site. CI tests
  (11 new cases) cover the happy path, ADC inference,
  no-project-anywhere, query exceptions, every row-shape
  failure mode, the mutex on event sources (both / neither),
  and the empty-SQL-file edge. Live BQ test
  (``tests/test_extractor_compilation_cli_revalidate_bq_live.py``)
  is gated behind ``BQAA_RUN_LIVE_BQ_REVALIDATE_TESTS=1``;
  it creates a temp table, inserts two ``event_json`` rows,
  runs the CLI, asserts the report is written with both
  events as compiled_unchanged + parity_matches, deletes
  the table on the way out.
- **``bqaa-revalidate-extractors`` CLI** in
  `bigquery_agent_analytics.extractor_compilation.cli_revalidate`
  and
  [`docs/extractor_compilation_revalidate_cli.md`](docs/extractor_compilation_revalidate_cli.md).
  Issue [#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75)
  follow-up to Milestone C2.d — operationalizes
  ``revalidate_compiled_extractors`` so ops can run periodic
  revalidation without writing Python. **Local inputs
  only** this round; ``--events-bq-query`` lands in a
  follow-up so the auth/location/pagination surface gets
  isolated from the operational-loop contract.
  Flags: ``--bundles-root`` (auto-detects the fingerprint
  from the first bundle's manifest; mixed fingerprints
  fail-closed), ``--events-jsonl`` (one event per line,
  malformed lines abort with line number), ``--reference-
  extractors-module`` (dotted path; module exposes
  ``EXTRACTORS: dict[str, callable]``, ``RESOLVED_GRAPH``
  from ``resolve(ontology, binding)``, and optionally
  ``SPEC`` — the CLI carries no ontology/binding flags
  because the reference module owns the validator-input
  contract), ``--thresholds-json`` (optional; JSON object
  with any subset of ``RevalidationThresholds`` fields,
  bounds-checked via the existing ``__post_init__``),
  ``--report-out`` (combined JSON of the raw
  ``RevalidationReport`` plus the ``ThresholdCheckResult``).
  Exit codes are deliberately narrow: ``0`` pass / ``1``
  threshold violation (report still written) / ``2``
  usage-or-input error (report not written). Wired through
  ``pyproject.toml [project.scripts]`` so
  ``pip install`` exposes the binary.
- **BigQuery-table bundle mirror** in
  `bigquery_agent_analytics.extractor_compilation.bq_bundle_mirror`
  and
  [`docs/extractor_compilation_bq_bundle_mirror.md`](docs/extractor_compilation_bq_bundle_mirror.md).
  Issue [#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75)
  PR C2.c.3 — publishes compiled bundles to a BigQuery
  table and syncs them back into a local directory for
  C2.a's existing loader. Runtime path stays
  ``sync_bundles_from_bq → discover_bundles →
  from_bundles_root``; the mirror is a utility, not a
  runtime loader. Public surface:
  ``publish_bundles_to_bq(bundle_root, store,
  bundle_fingerprint_allowlist=None)`` and
  ``sync_bundles_from_bq(store, dest_dir,
  bundle_fingerprint_allowlist=None)``. Both call
  :func:`load_bundle` as a gate — publish refuses bundles
  that wouldn't load at the runtime; sync refuses bundles
  whose reconstruction the loader rejects, scrubbing any
  partial directory it wrote. Sync writes each
  fingerprint to a side-by-side **staging directory** and
  runs ``load_bundle`` on the staged copy before performing
  a **staged replace** of the target (the rmtree+move pair
  is not strictly atomic — a crash between the two leaves
  the bundle absent on disk, recoverable by re-sync — but
  the load-bundle-failure direction *is* atomic, so a bad
  mirror row never destroys a previously-good local
  bundle).
  Strict bundle-shape check: the table stores exactly two
  rows per fingerprint (``manifest.json`` + the manifest's
  ``module_filename``); ``unexpected_file`` codes reject
  anything else. The manifest's own ``module_filename`` is
  shape-checked at sync (bare filename — no separators, no
  ``..``, no NUL); a path-separator value surfaces as
  ``manifest_row_unreadable`` instead of raising
  ``FileNotFoundError`` at the write step.
  ``invalid_bundle_path`` rejects traversal / absolute /
  backslash / NUL paths before writing to disk.
  ``duplicate_row`` rejects two rows sharing the same
  ``(fingerprint, bundle_path)`` (BigQuery has no unique
  constraint; the mirror enforces uniqueness at sync).
  ``duplicate_fingerprint`` rejects publish-side cases
  where two subdirs of ``bundle_root`` claim the same
  manifest fingerprint — neither is published, so the
  table can't end up with logical duplicates.
  ``malformed_row`` rejects rows with wrong field types.
  Idempotent republish via DELETE+INSERT in
  ``BigQueryBundleStore.publish_rows`` —
  re-publishing the same fingerprint replaces the prior
  rows rather than accumulating duplicates. The DELETE +
  ``insert_rows_json`` are NOT a single atomic
  transaction; a transient INSERT failure leaves rows
  missing until the caller re-runs publish (recoverable;
  documented in the class docstring).
  ``publish_rows`` also raises ``ValueError`` on duplicate
  ``(fingerprint, bundle_path)`` input pairs as defense in
  depth.
  ``BundleStore`` is a Protocol so tests can pass in-memory
  fakes; ``BigQueryBundleStore`` is the concrete
  implementation wrapping ``google.cloud.bigquery``.
  ``BUNDLE_MIRROR_TABLE_SCHEMA`` is exported for callers
  who need to create the table themselves (or
  ``BigQueryBundleStore.ensure_table()`` does it
  idempotently). Failure codes are stable strings;
  per-bundle problems land in ``failures`` instead of
  raising. Store exceptions (BQ-side: network, auth, table
  missing) propagate. Out of scope: GCS-backed signed-URL
  fetch, caching / TTL, garbage collection, multi-region
  replication.
- **Revalidation harness for compiled structured extractors**
  in
  `bigquery_agent_analytics.extractor_compilation.revalidation`
  and
  [`docs/extractor_compilation_revalidation.md`](docs/extractor_compilation_revalidation.md).
  Issue [#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75)
  PR C2.d — turns the compiled path from "works in tests" into
  "keeps proving itself after rollout." Public surface:
  ``revalidate_compiled_extractors(events,
  compiled_extractors, reference_extractors, resolved_graph,
  ...)`` drives ``run_with_fallback`` (with a no-op fallback)
  over a batch of events AND calls the reference extractor
  directly, aggregating the per-event outcomes into a
  ``RevalidationReport`` with **two orthogonal dimensions**:
  (1) runtime decision — per-event-type ``EventTypeCounts``
  plus totals for ``compiled_unchanged`` /
  ``compiled_filtered`` / ``fallback_for_event``, with
  ``compiled_path_faults`` split out so bundle bugs (the
  wrapper's ``compiled_exception`` audit field covers
  exceptions, wrong return type, and malformed result
  internals) are distinguishable from ontology drift; (2)
  agreement against reference — ``parity_matches`` /
  ``parity_divergences`` / ``parity_not_checked`` using a
  three-comparator parity check: ``_compare_nodes`` and
  ``_compare_span_handling`` from ``measurement.py`` plus
  ``_compare_edges`` in ``revalidation.py`` (same edge_id
  set with matching relationship_name / endpoints / property-
  set per shared edge; duplicate edge_ids on either side
  reported as a divergence rather than silently collapsed by
  dict keying, since #76 doesn't enforce edge-id
  uniqueness). The parity dimension catches **schema-valid
  but semantically wrong** outputs the validator would
  silently accept. **Every failure mode on the reference
  side becomes a parity divergence, never a batch abort**:
  exceptions, non-``StructuredExtractionResult`` returns
  (including ``None``), and comparator crashes all funnel
  into the divergence channel with a descriptive string. Headline KPIs:
  ``compiled_unchanged_rate`` (schema safety) and
  ``parity_match_rate`` (semantic agreement; denominator
  excludes ``parity_not_checked`` so wrapper-filtered events
  don't conflate with wrong-output events). Sample
  divergences are capped (per-dimension, independently) at 10
  by default. Skipped events (event_types without a compiled
  or reference extractor, malformed events) are counted
  separately from the rate denominators.
  ``check_thresholds(report, RevalidationThresholds(...))``
  evaluates the same report against policy gates;
  ``RevalidationThresholds`` validates rates are in
  ``[0, 1]`` (and rejects NaN / bool) at construction so a
  typo like ``max_fallback_for_event_rate=5`` fails loud
  instead of silently disabling the gate. Multiple
  thresholds all evaluated (no short-circuit), violations as
  human-readable strings naming the failed rate and bound.
  ``RevalidationReport.to_json()`` is deterministic for
  persistence + cross-run diffing. Out of scope (deferred):
  scheduled / cron orchestration, BigQuery / disk
  persistence, CLI binary, sampling strategy, auto-fix
  workflows.
- **Orchestrator call-site swap for compiled structured
  extractors** in
  `bigquery_agent_analytics.ontology_graph.OntologyGraphManager`
  and
  [`docs/extractor_compilation_orchestrator_swap.md`](docs/extractor_compilation_orchestrator_swap.md).
  Issue [#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75)
  PR C2.c.2 — the actual call-site swap that puts compiled
  extractors on the runtime path. New classmethod
  ``OntologyGraphManager.from_bundles_root(*, project_id,
  dataset_id, ontology, binding, bundles_root,
  expected_fingerprint, fallback_extractors, ...)`` builds the
  C2.c.1 registry adapter internally and constructs a manager
  whose ``extractors`` dict is the wrapped registry — so the
  existing ``run_structured_extractors`` call inside
  ``extract_graph`` picks up compiled-with-fallback behavior
  automatically. Manager exposes ``manager.runtime_registry:
  WrappedRegistry | None`` as the audit handle (non-``None``
  when bundle-wired; cross-reference
  ``runtime_registry.bundles_without_fallback`` /
  ``fallbacks_without_bundle`` /  ``discovery.failures`` for
  rollout-coverage telemetry). The existing ``__init__`` and
  ``from_ontology_binding`` paths are unchanged — direct-
  constructor callers leave ``runtime_registry = None`` and
  back-compat holds by construction. Compiled-only event_types
  without a matching fallback are NOT registered (fail-closed
  per C2.b's safety contract). Out of scope (deferred): BQ-
  table mirror (C2.c.3), revalidation harness (C2.d),
  ``AI.GENERATE`` fallback adapter.

  extractors** in

  existing ``run_structured_extractors`` hook. Wiring matrix:
  compiled+fallback → wrapped closure that calls
  ``run_with_fallback``; fallback-only → original callable
  registered unchanged; **compiled-only → skipped and recorded
  in ``bundles_without_fallback``** (C2's safety contract
  requires a fallback; fail-closed default). The inverse
  ``fallbacks_without_bundle`` audit surface records every
  event_type whose fallback has *no usable compiled registry
  entry* — that includes "bundle never built" and "bundle
  exists but discovery rejected it" (fingerprint mismatch,
  collision, ``manifest_unreadable``); rollout telemetry that
  wants to distinguish those cases should cross-reference
  ``discovery.failures``. ``fallback_extractors`` values are
  validated to be callable at build time (rejects ``None`` /
  non-callable with a ``TypeError`` naming the offending
  event_type) so misconfiguration surfaces immediately rather
  than silently in ``run_structured_extractors``.
  ``event_type_allowlist`` filters both candidate pools. The
  ``on_outcome`` callback fires on every wrapped invocation
  including ``compiled_unchanged`` (denominator metric for
  compiled-vs-fallback rate analysis); callback exceptions
  propagate. **This PR ships the adapter, not the orchestrator
  call-site swap** — that's C2.c.2. Out of scope (deferred):

  the source span and can recover the dropped facts. EVENT-
  scope failures, compiled-extractor exceptions, wrong return

  so the LLM can grep its own response), **bounded** (each
  section capped at the first ten entries with a truncation

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **LLM-as-Judge AI.GENERATE path now executes against current
  BigQuery.** Earlier versions emitted a table-valued
  ``FROM session_traces, AI.GENERATE(...) AS result`` shape with
  ``output_schema`` and a flat ``model_params`` dict. Current
  ``AI.GENERATE`` is a scalar function that returns a STRUCT;
  the table-valued form raises ``Table-valued function not found``
  and the flat ``model_params`` raises ``does not conform to the
  GenerateContent request body``. Mocked unit tests passed because
  they bypassed real query execution. The SDK now renders a
  ``SELECT AI.GENERATE(...).score, ...`` query with a
  ``generationConfig``-wrapped ``model_params`` and ``output_schema``
  on the scalar form, runs against live BigQuery, and unwraps the
  returned struct's ``score`` / ``justification`` / ``status``
  fields.
- **LLM-as-Judge AI.GENERATE / ML.GENERATE_TEXT now uses the full
  Python prompt template.** Previously both BQ-native paths sent
  only ``prompt_template.split('{trace_text}')[0]`` to BigQuery,
  silently dropping every instruction that followed the
  placeholders — including the per-criterion output-format spec
  the judge model needs to score consistently with the
  API-fallback path. The two BQ paths and the Python API path now
  produce comparable scores against the same prompt.

### Added

- ``evaluators.render_ai_generate_judge_query(...)`` is the new
  entry point that builds the AI.GENERATE batch SQL.
  ``connection_id`` is optional — when omitted the call uses
  end-user credentials; when supplied it inlines the
  ``connection_id =>`` argument so callers can route through a
  service-account-owned connection when their environment
  requires it.
- ``Client.connection_id`` already existed; it is now plumbed
  through to ``_ai_generate_judge`` so a connection set at client
  construction propagates to the judge SQL automatically.
- Live BigQuery integration tests for the LLM-judge AI.GENERATE
  path (``tests/test_ai_generate_judge_live.py``). Skipped by
  default; opt in with ``BQAA_RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1`` plus
  ``PROJECT_ID`` / ``DATASET_ID``. Three tests cover SQL parse
  acceptance, expected result-schema column names, and the
  ``connection_id`` escape hatch when
  ``BQAA_AI_GENERATE_CONNECTION_ID`` is set. Catches the class of
  mock-divergence bug that let the prior broken template ship.
- ``EvaluationReport.details["execution_mode"]`` is now populated
  for LLM-as-Judge runs with one of ``ai_generate``,
  ``ml_generate_text``, ``api_fallback``, or ``no_op`` — matching
  the value space the categorical evaluator already exposes. When
  an earlier tier raised before a later tier succeeded,
  ``details["fallback_reason"]`` carries the chained exception
  messages in attempt order, so CI and dashboards can audit which
  path actually ran.
- ``evaluators.split_judge_prompt_template(prompt_template)`` is
  the helper the SQL paths use to safely substitute the template
  into ``CONCAT()``; exposed publicly for downstream code that
  needs the same shape.
- ``bq-agent-sdk evaluate --exit-code`` FAIL lines now carry a
  bounded ``feedback="…"`` snippet drawn from
  ``SessionScore.llm_feedback`` for LLM-judge failures. The
  snippet collapses internal whitespace to a single space,
  truncates to 120 characters with an ellipsis, and is omitted
  entirely for code-based metrics (which leave ``llm_feedback``
  empty). CI logs now explain *why* the judge said the session
  failed without forcing the reader to chase the JSON output.

### Changed

- ``--strict`` help text and ``SDK.md §4`` clarified to match shipped
  behavior. ``--strict`` is a *visibility* knob — it stamps
  ``details['parse_error']=True`` on AI.GENERATE/ML.GENERATE_TEXT
  judge rows whose ``scores`` dict is empty, and adds a report-level
  ``parse_errors`` counter. It does **not** flip any session's
  pass/fail outcome: both BQ-native judge methods compute ``passed``
  as ``bool(scores) and all(...)``, so empty-scores rows already
  fail without the flag. API-fallback parse errors coerce to
  ``score=0.0``, so they fail as low-score failures rather than
  parse errors. For pass/fail-only CI consumers ``--strict`` is a
  no-op; reach for it when a dashboard needs to tell "no parseable
  score" apart from "low score."

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-24

### Changed (breaking)

- **Prebuilt `CodeEvaluator` gates now compare raw observed values
  directly against the user-supplied budget.** `CodeEvaluator.latency`,
  `.turn_count`, `.error_rate`, `.token_efficiency`, `.ttft`, and
  `.cost_per_session` return `1.0` when the observed metric is within
  budget and `0.0` otherwise. The previous implementation scored sessions
  on a normalized `1.0 - (observed / budget)` scale against a `0.5` pass
  cutoff, which effectively fired every gate at roughly half the budget
  the user typed (e.g. `latency(threshold_ms=5000)` failed sessions at
  `avg_latency_ms > 2500`). Users relying on the old sub-budget fail
  behavior should lower their budgets to match their intent.
- The scheduled streaming evaluator (`streaming_observability_v1`) uses
  the same raw-budget gate semantics for consistency with the prebuilt
  `CodeEvaluator` factories.

### Added

- `CodeEvaluator.add_metric` accepts `observed_key`, `observed_fn`, and
  `budget` arguments that flow into `SessionScore.details[f"metric_{name}"]`
  for downstream reporting. The CLI uses these to emit readable failure
  lines without re-running the scorer.
- `bq-agent-sdk evaluate --exit-code` now prints a per-session failure
  summary on stderr before exiting non-zero. Each line names the
  session_id, failing metric, observed value, and the budget it blew
  through. Output is capped at the first 10 failing sessions to keep
  CI logs scannable.
- `bq-agent-sdk categorical-eval` gains `--exit-code`,
  `--min-pass-rate`, and `--pass-category METRIC=CATEGORY`
  (repeatable) flags. Declare which classification counts as passing
  per metric, set a minimum pass rate across the run, and fail CI when
  any metric falls below it. Multiple pass categories per metric are
  OR'd together (e.g. `--pass-category tone=positive --pass-category
  tone=neutral`). Missing metric names warn on stderr without failing
  the run so configuration mistakes are visible in CI logs.
